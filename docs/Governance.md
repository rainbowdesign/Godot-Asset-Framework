# Governance

This project is a collaborative effort. Its success depends on open discussion, clear reasoning, and mutual respect among contributors. The following principles define how decisions are made and how the community works together.

## 1. Reasoned Decision-Making
All decisions should be based on clear reasoning. Contributors are encouraged to explain the motivation, expected benefits, and potential trade-offs of their proposals. Well-structured arguments help the community evaluate ideas on their merits rather than on personal preference.

## 2. Consensus as the Goal
For major project decisions—such as architectural direction, feature scope, or coding standards—the preferred outcome is consensus. Contributors are expected to engage in constructive discussion, listen to differing perspectives, and work toward solutions that balance practicality with long-term sustainability.

## 3. Adaptability When Consensus Cannot Be Reached
If consensus cannot be reached, the governance approach may be adapted to ensure progress. This may involve:
- A vote among maintainers,
- Delegation of authority to a designated lead,
- Or another agreed-upon mechanism.

The guiding principle is that the project must remain active and forward-moving, even when opinions differ.

## 4. Transparency
All significant decisions should be documented in the repository (e.g., in issues, pull requests, or dedicated decision records). This ensures that contributors and future maintainers understand the reasoning behind past choices.

## 5. Respectful Collaboration
Disagreements are natural in collaborative projects. Contributors are expected to remain respectful, focus on the technical or design issues at hand, and avoid personal conflict. The community thrives when discussions are constructive and inclusive.
