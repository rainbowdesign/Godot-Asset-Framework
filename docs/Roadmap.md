# Roadmap ( draft )

The primary focus of this project is **integration, not duplication**.  
Rather than writing every system from scratch, the goal is to **aggregate high‑quality features from existing projects**, unify them under consistent standards, and provide a cohesive set of addons that developers can rely on.  
Distribution will be handled as a **downloadable addon set**, ideally published through the **Godot Asset Library** so it can be installed directly from inside the Godot editor.

---

## 1. Guiding Principles
- Prioritize **quality over quantity**: only integrate features that meet high standards.  
- Favor **aggregation and refinement** over re‑implementation.  
- Ensure **consistency** across integrated modules (coding style, documentation, testing).  
- Maintain **transparency** about the origin of integrated features and their licenses.  
- Build a **sustainable foundation** that can grow through community contributions.  
- Provide the addon set as a **single curated package**, downloadable from the Godot Asset Library.

---

## 2. Short‑Term Goals (Foundation)
- Identify and evaluate existing open‑source Godot projects and addons.  
- Define **quality standards** for integration (coding style, documentation, test coverage).  
- Begin integrating a small set of **core systems** (e.g., input handling, save/load, UI).  
- Provide a **reference Godot project** demonstrating integration of these systems.  
- Prepare the **addon set structure** (`addons/` folder with modular plugins).  
- Submit the first release to the **Godot Asset Library** for distribution.

---

## 3. Medium‑Term Goals (Expansion)
- Expand the library by integrating additional high‑quality modules:
  - Inventory and item systems  
  - Dialogue and quest frameworks  
  - Character controllers (2D and 3D)  
  - AI behaviors  
- Document integration processes so contributors can propose new modules.  
- Establish a **review process** for evaluating candidate projects before integration.  
- Publish regular updates to the **Asset Library**, ensuring users can always install the latest curated set directly from the editor.

---

## 4. Long‑Term Goals (Vision)
- Deliver a **comprehensive, curated library** of reusable modules.  
- Provide **genre‑specific starter kits** built from the integrated modules (e.g., 2D Metroidvania, 3D RPG, Farming Sim).  
- Maintain a **living catalog** of integrated features with clear documentation and examples.  
- Ensure the project remains **cohesive and unified**, even as it grows in scope.  
- Become a **trusted resource in the Godot Asset Library**, known for quality and reliability.  

---

## 5. Scope Considerations
- The project will **start small**, focusing on a high‑quality core.  
- Expansion will be gradual, based on contributor capacity and available high‑quality assets.  
- Modules should be **feature‑complete** before integration, but the decision rests with the module author.  
- The balance between **breadth** (many modules) and **depth** (polished modules) will be guided by community discussion.  

---

## 6. Review and Updates
- This roadmap will be updated regularly as new projects are identified for integration.  
- Major changes in scope or direction will be documented transparently.  
- The community will play a central role in identifying, evaluating, and integrating features.
