# Architecture Framework Draft
# Architectural Essentials

This part outlines the core goals that guide the architecture of the project.  
They represent the fundamental qualities assumed to be required to keep the project sustainable, adaptable, and cohesive.

## 1. Extensibility
**Goal:** The system should allow new features to be added without breaking existing functionality.  
- Encourage designs that support growth.  
- Avoid rigid structures that block future development.  

## 2. Maintainability
**Goal:** The codebase should remain understandable and manageable over time.  
- Favor clarity over cleverness.  
- Ensure contributors can easily read, modify, and improve the code.  

## 3. Reusability
**Goal:** Core systems should be usable across multiple contexts and genres.  
- Design modules to be generic where possible.  
- Avoid hard‑coding assumptions that limit applicability.  

## 4. Scalability
**Goal:** The architecture should support both small prototypes and large, complex projects.  
- Systems should perform well at different scales.  
- Growth in scope should not require a complete redesign.  

## 5. Cohesion
**Goal:** The project must remain unified and consistent as it grows.  
- Maintain a shared vision across modules.  
- Prevent fragmentation into incompatible approaches.  

## 6. Performance Awareness
**Goal:** Avoid unnecessary overhead and design for efficiency.  
- Optimize where it matters, without premature micro‑optimization.  
- Ensure systems remain responsive and resource‑conscious.  

## 7. Quality Standards
**Goal:** Create a codebase that maintains the highest possible quality standards.  

# Architectural Decisions

In addition to the core essentials, there are several areas where the project must make deliberate choices.  
These decisions are less straightforward and should be discussed openly within the community.  
The following topics represent key points where trade‑offs exist and consensus is needed.

## 1. Testability
**Question:** How should the project structure its code to support automated testing?  
- Options include requiring tests for all modules, setting minimum coverage thresholds, or leaving flexibility to contributors.  
- The balance to strike is between ensuring reliability and avoiding barriers to contribution.

## 2. Transparency
**Question:** How should architectural decisions and trade‑offs be documented?  
- Options include lightweight decision records in the repository, detailed design documents, or discussion threads linked to issues/PRs.  
- The goal is to ensure contributors understand *why* choices were made, not just *what* was chosen.

## 3. Community Contribution Formats
**Question:** How should contributions be structured and reviewed?  
- This includes how pull requests are handled, what level of review is required, and whether contributors should follow specific templates.  
- Possible approaches range from lightweight, flexible reviews to more formal multi‑maintainer approvals.

## 4. Scope
**Question:** How broad should the project’s scope be?  
- Should it aim to provide a single flexible foundation for many genres, or focus on a narrower set of use cases?  
- **Possible answer:** Start with a small, high‑quality core and expand gradually as capacity allows.  
  - This would be a personal decision, balancing ambition with sustainability.

## 5. Module Feature Goals
**Question:** How complete should modules be before they are considered part of the project?  
- Options include building many modules quickly with limited functionality, or focusing on fewer modules until they are feature‑complete.  
- **Possible answer:** Modules should be worked on until they are feature‑complete before being merged.  
- However, this remains a personal decision of the contributor who authors the module, and they may choose the balance between speed and completeness for their own work.

## 6. Coding Style
**Question:** What coding style would the Project use?
- **Possible answer:** This project follows the official [Godot GDScript Style Guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).
