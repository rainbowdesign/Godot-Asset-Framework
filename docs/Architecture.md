# Architectural Essentials

This part outlines the core goals that guide the architecture of the project.  
They represent the fundamental qualities required to keep the project sustainable, adaptable, and cohesive.

## 1. Extensibility
**Goal:** The system should allow new features to be added without breaking existing functionality.  
- Encourage designs that support growth.  
- Avoid rigid structures that block future development.  

## 2. Maintainability
**Goal:** The codebase should remain understandable and manageable over time.  
- Favor clarity over cleverness.  
- Ensure contributors can easily read, modify, and improve the code.  

## 3. Reusability
**Goal:** Core systems should be usable across multiple contexts and genres.  
- Design modules to be generic where possible.  
- Avoid hard‑coding assumptions that limit applicability.  

## 4. Scalability
**Goal:** The architecture should support both small prototypes and large, complex projects.  
- Systems should perform well at different scales.  
- Growth in scope should not require a complete redesign.  

## 5. Cohesion
**Goal:** The project must remain unified and consistent as it grows.  
- Maintain a shared vision across modules.  
- Prevent fragmentation into incompatible approaches.  

## 6. Performance Awareness
**Goal:** Avoid unnecessary overhead and design for efficiency.  
- Optimize where it matters, without premature micro‑optimization.  
- Ensure systems remain responsive and resource‑conscious.
